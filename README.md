## Davalos Clothing Website

Davalos Clothing is a project I created for a client to list clothing that they wanted to highlight for sale. This web application should provide the basic functionality of a public-facing ecommerce website that allows customers to view, favorite, and purchase clothing listed by the Seller (client).

Testing was conducted by running the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```
## Features

The web application should incorporate the following features:

- Intuitive User Interface (UI) with quick navigation buttons from the Home landing page.
- Ability to add clothing into a Shopping Cart
- Authentication and Authorization for both shoppers and sellers (client).
- Search capability
- Favorites capability
- Contact and About Us pages
- Custom 404 Not Found page
